Nexts steps are a test setup, after the initial idea is roughly shaped into code. Then come all the things in "thoughts.txt".

## Usage

You need a mongodb, python and nodejs.
Everything is setup for development; start the frontend with "npm run dev" and the python server with "./server.py". Your mongodb should be running on localhost.
